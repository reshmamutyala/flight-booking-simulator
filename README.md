# Project Overview

Simulates a real-world airline booking system.

Implements dynamic pricing based on seat availability, time to departure, and demand.

Developed using Python and FastAPI with MySQL for data storage.

Demonstrates practical knowledge of web development, RESTful APIs, and algorithmic pricing.

# Key Features

Search Flights: Find flights by origin, destination, and travel date.

Book Flights: Complete bookings with updated pricing.

Dynamic Pricing Engine: Real-time fare adjustments for realistic simulation.

RESTful API Endpoints: Retrieve, search, and manage flight data programmatically.

Simulation of Airline Behavior: Mimics pricing and booking strategies used in the airline industry.
# backend 
my backend file consists of two milestones 
1. Build REST APIs using Flask/FastAPI/Django for:
 • Retrieving all flights
 • Searching by origin, destination, and date
2. Implement input validation and sorting (by price or duration)
3. Simulate external airline schedule APIs
4. Design dynamic pricing logic considering:
 • Remaining seat percentage
 • Time until departure
 • Simulated demand level
 • Base fare and pricing tiers
5. Integrate dynamic pricing engine into flight search API
6. Build background process to simulate demand/availability changes
7. Store fare history for tracking changes

the above mentioned are the tasks done in milestone 2
where my milestone 3 consists of booking workflow and transaction management
